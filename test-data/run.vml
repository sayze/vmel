# This is an example config which vmel interpreter can read and execute.
# There are 2 distinct sections on for Variables and another define groups of actions.

# ---------------------------------- # 
#            Variables               #
# ---------------------------------- #
# Variables must be prefixed with a dollar sign... yes I do like PHP.
# Such as the below

$var_str = "sayed@root" # A String
$var_int = 12 # An Int
$var_int2 = $var_int # Variable assignment
$var_expr = 12 + 45 * (34 -1) # Expression assignment

print "hello world" # Printing a string
print 12 # Printing an int
print 13 + 44 - 1 # Printing an expression
print $var_int # Printing a variable
#print `Dear $var_str, hope you are having a great day.` # Printing mixed string

# ---------------------------------- # 
#            Groups                  #
# ---------------------------------- #
# Groups as the name suggests are a collection or "group" of related tasks.
# Each group must contain a unique name, most likely a name that describes the tasks.
# Each Group may have a variable amount of tasks to be performed. Refer to the below.
